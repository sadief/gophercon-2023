## Scaling Coffee with Goroutines

We'll walk through together from step 1 how to spin up a small web app and use Goroutines to take advantage of Go's impressive concurrency. By the end you'll be comfortable with:

- Using goroutines to run multiple functions at the same time
- Using wait groups to ensure goroutines have finished
- Running goroutines within goroutines for even better performance
- Basic Docker deployment
- Kubernetes deployment from a Docker image
- Kubernetes resource setting and scaling

**Note:** If you would prefer to run this locally there are code examples[here](https://github.com/sadief/gophercon-2023-slides-code).
